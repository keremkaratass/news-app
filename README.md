# Newsapp
It was developed together with @yavuzkirikci and @fatihguner41. The application also includes: 
- The user can log in and out.
- The user can select their favorite news categories and newspapers and change them later.
- The user can save and like a news story he is looking at. When he likes it, he will start to come across the news of that category and newspaper heavily.
- The user can search for a word or sentence from the search section. If what he is looking for is available, all the news he is involved in is coming.

I've put a few images from the app below.
